//This started as a small side-project to learn how to use Unity but I still continue to work on it sparactically.
//The art takes me the longest (and is the least fun to work on) so most towers just have placeholder animations until I force myself draw new ones.
//I am also more of a backend guy so the UI isn't very pretty.
//As I was just learning how to use Unity, code in C#, and program in general when I started this; there are a lot of things I would like to go back and optimize eventaully in older scripts but I just can't force myself to redo old code when i have new ideas I really want to add.
//Unfortunatly, my inexperienxce when I started also led to the lack of comments throughout the project.
//Right now, the UI is not finished and I'm not even sure how I want it to look. In lieu of buttons, press space to send waves, z to speed up, x to slow down, and right-click to reset. You can also use numbers to spawn enemies and the top row of letters to spawn towers.
